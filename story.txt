Boltman is a superhero living in the distant future. He has the power to control electricity. He lives in a futuristic and utopian version of what America used to be. However, in recent times, the crime rate has started to rise and he doesn't know why...
It was all the work of the super villain Dio Brando. Dio sent out his minions to take control of PlatteVille, so that he can usurp the mayor and change the town's football mascot to himself. 

Boltman knew that Dio Brando must be stopped. But how? How could he use his
super-electrical powers to thwart such a devious villain? A town's football 
mascot is a prized possesion: PlatteVille must not be represented by such a
horrific creature. That's it! Football! Boltman could use the large floodlights
around the football stadium to illuminate Dio and his minions at all times. It's
tough to be secretive when the whole town knows where you are.
